1
00:00:05,618 --> 00:00:09,086
The goal in this video isto display the details for      

2
00:00:09,087 --> 00:00:11,900
the comic book thatwas clicked on.      

3
00:00:11,901 --> 00:00:14,190
So let's go ahead andget started.      

4
00:00:14,191 --> 00:00:17,530
We'll do a couple of otherthings as well in this video.      

5
00:00:17,531 --> 00:00:22,140
The first thing I wannado is to lay out that      

6
00:00:22,141 --> 00:00:25,370
grid that willcontain the details.      

7
00:00:25,371 --> 00:00:28,962
So, I'm gonna take a momenthere and do some formatting.      

8
00:00:28,963 --> 00:00:35,400
So commenting,      

9
00:00:35,401 --> 00:00:38,480
so that I can easily findwhat I'm looking for.      

10
00:00:38,481 --> 00:00:41,190
Because things are starting toget a little bit hectic here.      

11
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,974
So this will be      

12
00:00:46,975 --> 00:00:54,570
the character detail.      

13
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:04,279
And then this would bethe the Detail Grid.      

14
00:01:07,483 --> 00:01:09,900
All right,that should help a little bit.      

15
00:01:09,901 --> 00:01:12,730
Right, so under Comic Detailswe're gonna add another grid.      

16
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:18,069
We're gonna put thisgrid in the third row.      

17
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:23,673
Remember, we created three rows,and      

18
00:01:23,674 --> 00:01:26,954
this is going to the last one,      

19
00:01:26,955 --> 00:01:31,828
and we'll just go ahead andset all of this.      

20
00:01:39,467 --> 00:01:44,327
All right, and inside of thisgrid, I'm going to create pretty      

21
00:01:44,328 --> 00:01:48,827
much like what we did last timewhere we had for the character      

22
00:01:48,828 --> 00:01:52,970
detail, we had the definitionsfor columns and rows.      

23
00:01:52,971 --> 00:02:00,780
I'm just gonna copy that exactlyand reuse it here with Comics.      

24
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,460
And I see I've alreadymade a mistake here.      

25
00:02:04,461 --> 00:02:06,851
There we go.      

26
00:02:10,845 --> 00:02:12,186
Nice.      

27
00:02:12,187 --> 00:02:14,378
All right, andthen inside of here,      

28
00:02:14,379 --> 00:02:17,576
I'm going to create prettymuch like what I did here.      

29
00:02:17,577 --> 00:02:19,799
In fact, let me just goahead and grab this.      

30
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:25,100
And I wanna paste it.      

31
00:02:25,101 --> 00:02:27,750
And here we're gonna go,instead of just DetailImages,      

32
00:02:27,751 --> 00:02:29,310
it will be ComicDetailImages.      

33
00:02:29,311 --> 00:02:32,590
Instead of DetailName,it'll be ComicDetailNames.      

34
00:02:32,591 --> 00:02:34,060
Instead of DetailDescription,      

35
00:02:34,061 --> 00:02:36,448
it'll beComicDetailDescriptionTextBlock.      

36
00:02:36,449 --> 00:02:40,240
It's easy enough.      

37
00:02:40,241 --> 00:02:43,190
All righty, and now,      

38
00:02:43,191 --> 00:02:48,590
what I wanna do is lookat this List of Comics.      

39
00:02:48,591 --> 00:02:52,380
Currently, I didn't givethe GridView and name before I      

40
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:56,260
created the item click,I'm going to give it a name now.      

41
00:02:56,261 --> 00:03:01,893
And we're going to call this,ComicsGridView.      

42
00:03:01,894 --> 00:03:09,020
And so, this should bethe ComicsGridView_ItemClick.      

43
00:03:09,021 --> 00:03:13,971
And inside onthe MainPage.xml.cs,      

44
00:03:13,972 --> 00:03:20,726
let's rename this toComicsGridview_ItemClick.      

45
00:03:22,677 --> 00:03:27,556
So, in this what we're gonnado is essentially exactly what      

46
00:03:27,557 --> 00:03:31,000
we did here where wegrabbed off the item and      

47
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:34,770
then we startedpopulating things.      

48
00:03:34,771 --> 00:03:38,250
So let's go ahead and justcopy that code, paste it here.      

49
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:39,998
And we're gonnachange everything up      

50
00:03:39,999 --> 00:03:41,202
from Character to Comic.      

51
00:03:46,635 --> 00:03:50,095
ComicBook.      

52
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:52,115
selectedComic.      

53
00:03:55,992 --> 00:04:00,530
And the comic has a title,not a name.      

54
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:02,186
So we'll change that.      

55
00:04:06,365 --> 00:04:10,110
Otherwise, everything willbe just about correct.      

56
00:04:10,111 --> 00:04:14,780
Let's make sure we'resetting ComicDetailName in      

57
00:04:14,781 --> 00:04:17,334
ComicDetailDescription.      

58
00:04:17,335 --> 00:04:18,449
All right.      

59
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:23,603
Let's run it, see if it works.      

60
00:04:37,976 --> 00:04:41,070
Okay, and eventually we gotit to completely fill in.      

61
00:04:41,071 --> 00:04:42,260
Awesome.      

62
00:04:42,261 --> 00:04:43,540
We'll select Crimson Dynamo.      

63
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:46,590
Great.      

64
00:04:46,591 --> 00:04:50,360
And I'm gonna select one ofthe items, like that comic.      

65
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,530
Okay, you can see thatwe do see the details,      

66
00:04:56,531 --> 00:05:00,190
but I have to basically resizethe window so I can get to it.      

67
00:05:00,191 --> 00:05:01,910
There's no Scroll viewer.      

68
00:05:01,911 --> 00:05:03,010
So let's change that.      

69
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:07,010
Let's go back tothe MainPage.xml and I add      

70
00:05:07,011 --> 00:05:12,760
a outermost grid,inside of that a scroll viewer.      

71
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:19,270
So here I'm gonna go Grid andthen ScrollViewer.      

72
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:22,970
Like that.      

73
00:05:22,971 --> 00:05:26,080
And then,I'm gonna just grab everything      

74
00:05:26,081 --> 00:05:30,590
that we've previously done,cut it, and paste it in.      

75
00:05:30,591 --> 00:05:32,240
And the reason I'mdoing it this way is      

76
00:05:32,241 --> 00:05:34,190
because then the indentationwill be right.      

77
00:05:34,191 --> 00:05:36,930
If we just tried to wrapthe grid and scroll viewer      

78
00:05:36,931 --> 00:05:40,610
around the existing code,it doesn't work as well.      

79
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:45,370
I've found in myunfortunate experiences.      

80
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:49,940
All right.      

81
00:05:49,941 --> 00:05:54,540
Fin Fang Foom,interesting character.      

82
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:04,330
And let's choose one of thecomics and we can see whoops.      

83
00:06:04,331 --> 00:06:06,214
Okay, now what do we have here?      

84
00:06:11,265 --> 00:06:15,040
All right, in this case thedescription is actually null.      

85
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,541
So maybe we need todo a check for that.      

86
00:06:36,233 --> 00:06:40,227
Okay great, try that again.      

87
00:06:44,847 --> 00:06:48,417
And this is why you wanna test,and test, and test, and keep      

88
00:06:48,418 --> 00:06:52,273
running the application, keepusing it, because eventually,      

89
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:01,391
You're gonna find new, and      

90
00:07:01,392 --> 00:07:06,065
interesting problemswith the application.      

91
00:07:06,066 --> 00:07:08,944
The more you test it the morestable it'll be eventually.      

92
00:07:13,216 --> 00:07:16,800
Okay, now I just discovereda bug if you noticed that.      

93
00:07:16,801 --> 00:07:22,690
Previously, we had selecteda comic and displayed it here.      

94
00:07:22,691 --> 00:07:26,832
And then I selecteda new character.      

95
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:29,743
The comicbooks changed, butas you can see, without making      

96
00:07:29,744 --> 00:07:32,320
a selection, all of the previousdata is still here.      

97
00:07:32,321 --> 00:07:37,412
So what we'll need todo is add a little      

98
00:07:37,413 --> 00:07:45,539
bit of logic right here whereyou click on a given new person.      

99
00:07:49,417 --> 00:07:52,368
So, I don't know where wecan put that it doesn't      

100
00:07:52,369 --> 00:07:55,895
really matter, here we'll putit right here this is fine.      

101
00:07:55,896 --> 00:08:00,752
So we move the comicdetail description      

102
00:08:00,753 --> 00:08:08,704
setting that to empty string ComicDetailMainTextBlock.Test      

103
00:08:08,705 --> 00:08:12,440
equals empty string.      

104
00:08:12,441 --> 00:08:17,259
And then we'll goComicDetailImage and      

105
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:21,658
we'll set its sourceequal to null.      

106
00:08:21,659 --> 00:08:22,911
Let's see if that works.      

107
00:08:33,964 --> 00:08:36,243
Just curious what happens,while we're still loading this,      

108
00:08:36,244 --> 00:08:37,220
if I can click on that.      

109
00:08:37,221 --> 00:08:38,645
And I can.      

110
00:08:38,646 --> 00:08:40,150
And that's the beauty of async.      

111
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,990
All right, so we've selecteda comic from Giant Man,      

112
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:47,610
and I'm going to changeto a different character.      

113
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:52,645
And all the details about thatcomic go away, as well the list      

114
00:08:52,646 --> 00:08:56,122
of comics for the previouscharacter for Giant Man.      

115
00:08:56,123 --> 00:08:56,914
All right, perfect.      

116
00:08:59,051 --> 00:09:00,281
Click Goliath.      

117
00:09:03,996 --> 00:09:08,083
All right, let's choose comic,beautiful.      

118
00:09:10,196 --> 00:09:11,750
Okay, very good.      

119
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:15,514
The last thing I'dwant to do is,      

120
00:09:18,765 --> 00:09:23,643
I'm considering doing somethinglike this that we did earlier      

121
00:09:23,644 --> 00:09:26,503
for the characters forcomic books.      

122
00:09:26,504 --> 00:09:32,019
I'm just not sureif it's necessary.      

123
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:36,294
Boy, it's a hard call,where do we make that call in?      

124
00:09:36,295 --> 00:09:40,568
Yeah we make it right thereI guess it wouldn't hurt.      

125
00:09:40,569 --> 00:09:45,140
Let's do this.      

126
00:09:45,141 --> 00:09:48,830
Going to copy it, more fora template than anything else.      

127
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:53,850
And what we'll dois grab this off,      

128
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:00,330
enter that there andchange that to Comics.      

129
00:10:00,331 --> 00:10:04,156
Let's move      

130
00:10:04,157 --> 00:10:10,235
this guy over a little bit,move that guy over a little bit.      

131
00:10:10,236 --> 00:10:12,575
And we'll remove that.      

132
00:10:15,923 --> 00:10:20,405
So this should ensure that weget ten comics, if they exist.      

133
00:10:20,406 --> 00:10:21,935
Now, if they don't exist.      

134
00:10:23,085 --> 00:10:27,105
Hm, see this is where thingsget a little bit tricky.      

135
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:34,860
See, I know in this case thatthere are 1,500 characters.      

136
00:10:34,861 --> 00:10:38,463
What I don't know is that ifevery single character has at      

137
00:10:38,464 --> 00:10:41,175
least ten comic booksassociated with it.      

138
00:10:41,176 --> 00:10:42,174
It may have zero.      

139
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:48,060
But there would be no wayto really figure that out,      

140
00:10:51,008 --> 00:10:54,670
Without passing back some pieceof information, like account.      

141
00:10:56,310 --> 00:11:00,280
So, I'm going to backtrackaway from this idea.      

142
00:11:00,281 --> 00:11:02,810
You can experiment withthis if you'd like.      

143
00:11:02,811 --> 00:11:04,300
But, the danger is,      

144
00:11:04,301 --> 00:11:08,470
that you would end up makingan unlimited number of calls.      

145
00:11:08,471 --> 00:11:12,180
Returning back the samecount of one or      

146
00:11:12,181 --> 00:11:14,780
two comics, andyou wouldn't want to do that.      

147
00:11:14,781 --> 00:11:19,169
You would use up all thousandof your requests in about ten      

148
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:20,540
seconds.      

149
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:24,990
So we're gonna go back or I'llleave that code commented out so      

150
00:11:24,991 --> 00:11:29,310
that you can maybe think aboutsome alternative strategies that      

151
00:11:29,311 --> 00:11:33,750
allow you to filterout the exceptions,      

152
00:11:33,751 --> 00:11:35,220
make sure that an exceptiondidn't happen.      

153
00:11:35,221 --> 00:11:40,667
Maybe that's all we needto do here actually.      

154
00:11:40,668 --> 00:11:41,370
We'll just do this.      

155
00:11:45,075 --> 00:11:46,150
Okay, we'll leave it at that.      

156
00:11:47,922 --> 00:11:50,810
All right, so that's all thatI wanted to do in this lesson.      

157
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:53,660
I'm pretty happywhere things are at.      

158
00:11:53,661 --> 00:11:57,320
The next thing I want to dois add an adaptive layout so      

159
00:11:57,321 --> 00:11:59,970
that we can resize andthings look good.      

160
00:11:59,971 --> 00:12:01,591
So we'll do thatin the next video.      

161
00:12:01,592 --> 00:12:03,007
See you there, thanks.
